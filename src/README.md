# Steps to follow to analyze data

Nicole codes using RMarkdown, embedding code and results with extensive commentary. All scripts are therefore .Rmd files. You'll want to use RStudio to run these. They *should* work if you simply click "knit", assuming you have all the necessary files in the right folder structure.

*Note:* Make sure you've pre-processed all of the avian and VRI data or it won't be in the right format. Alternatively, you could just use the pre-processed/cached versions, assuming you have access to them from Nicole.

### Scripts used for this round


* rank description (need to rerun after I cleaned up ranks  from shapefile)


* sampling representation after filtering temporal representation. 


Rank vs. bird density


SAM of bird density ~ whatever covariates I need. 


possible: evaluation of biological hypotheses.
