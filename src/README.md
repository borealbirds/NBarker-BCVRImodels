# Steps to follow in pre-processing avian and Vegetation Resource Inventory (VRI) data for analyses

Nicole codes using RMarkdown, embedding code and results with extensive commentary. All scripts are therefore .Rmd files. You'll want to use RStudio to run these. They *should* work if you simply click "knit", assuming you have all the necessary files in the right folder structure.

*Note:* Several scripts were used for quality-checks and inspecting for consistencies among datasets. These are not always included in the workflow because they were completed before this round of analyses. Contact me directly at nbarker@ualberta.ca if something seems amiss or if you want further detail. 

### Scripts used for this round

1. **01.01.Describe_VRI.Rmd** - 

2. **01.02.Sampling_Representation.Rmd** - Summarize how well the various forest stand types are represented by bird point count surveys collected within reasonable timeframe to the conditions likely presented in the VRI shapefile. 





Rank vs. bird density - forsite only


SAM of bird density ~ whatever covariates I need. - Forsite + Canfor if covariates are present. 


possible: evaluation of biological hypotheses.
