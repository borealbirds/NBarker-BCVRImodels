## Background

* On Nov 28, 2017, Trish sent me intersections between the latest avian data and the BC VRI dataset. 
* In early- and mid-December, I cleaned up the VRI files and the bird files


**FILES**

1. bc_atlas_ident.csv
2. BC_CanforTFLvri_bampointsIdent.csv
3. BC_CanforTFLvri_WSI.csv
4. bcBAM_noAtlas_ident.csv
5. bcbbs_ident.csv
6. bcwsi_ident.csv

In this script, I: 

* Inspect each file independently for duplicates
* Inspect the combined file for duplicates and make decision on which to exclude
* Extract the FIXED VRI data from the full VRI file

``` {r setup, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
require(knitr)
opts_knit$set(root.dir = '..')
```

``` {r load.project, message=F}
require(ProjectTemplate)
load.project()
options(digits=12)
```

## Load datasets and look for duplicates within datasets

* Duplicate SS, indicating we might have the same data in the dataset twice
* Duplicate location, indicating we might have data from the same surveys recorded under different survey names. 

##### 1. bc_atlas_ident.csv

Intersection of the Atlas (BCCA) points with Forsite's "mig bird layer". Their modified version of the VRI dataset with modified BecZone, SpeciesGroup, Age, Height, and Rank fields. 

``` {r}
atlas <- read.csv("data/bc_atlas_ident.csv", header=T)
colnames(atlas)[1:10]
atlas.sm <- atlas[c("FID_BC_BCCA_SelectedMigLayer", "PCODE", "SS", "FID_migratory_bird")]
```

Which SS are duplicated within datasets? 

``` {r}
kable(atlas.sm[atlas.sm$SS %in% atlas.sm$SS[duplicated(atlas.sm$SS)],], row.names=F)
```

**NOTES**

* Looking at these duplicated sites individually, I noticed that they are each on the border between two VRI polygons. They will therefore be omitted from the analyses anyway at a later stage, so I won't worry about them now.

##### 2. BC_CanforTFLvri_bampointsIdent.csv

Intersection of BAM points (Version 4 of the Avian Database) with VRI data from Canfor's TFL. It doesn't have new variables for BecZone, SpeciesGroup, Age, Height, and therefore doesn't have Rank. 

``` {r}
canfortfl <- read.csv("data/BC_CanforTFLvri_bampointsIdent.csv", header=T)
colnames(canfortfl)[1:15]
canfortfl.sm <- canfortfl[c("FID_XYBC_Natv4_TFLCanfor", "PCODE", "SS", "FID_Canfor_TFL_VRI")]
```

Which SS are duplicated within datasets? 

``` {r}
kable(canfortfl.sm[canfortfl.sm$SS %in% canfortfl.sm$SS[duplicated(canfortfl.sm$SS)],], row.names=F)
```

**NOTES**

* No SS duplicated


##### 3. BC_CanforTFLvri_WSI.csv

Intersection of new points (from the WSI database) with VRI data from Canfor's TFL. It doesn't have new variables for BecZone, SpeciesGroup, Age, Height, and therefore doesn't have Rank. 

``` {r}
canfortflwsi <- read.csv("data/BC_CanforTFLvri_WSI.csv", header=T)
colnames(canfortflwsi)[1:15]
canfortflwsi.sm <- canfortflwsi[c("FID_XY_WSI_TFLCanfor", "PCODE", "SS", "FID_Canfor_TFL_VRI")]
```

Which SS are duplicated within datasets? 

``` {r}
kable(canfortflwsi.sm[canfortflwsi.sm$SS %in% canfortflwsi.sm$SS[duplicated(canfortflwsi.sm$SS)],], row.names=F)
```

**NOTES**

* No SS duplicated

##### 4. bcBAM_noAtlas_ident.csv

Intersection of BAM points (Version 4 of the Avian Database) with Forsite's "mig bird layer". Their modified version of the VRI dataset with modified BecZone, SpeciesGroup, Age, Height, and Rank fields. 

``` {r}
bam <- read.csv("data/bcBAM_noAtlas_ident.csv", header=T)
colnames(bam)[1:18]
bam.sm <- bam[c("FID_BCdatanat4", "PCODE", "SS", "FID_migratory_bird")]
```

Which SS are duplicated within datasets? 

``` {r}
kable(bam.sm[bam.sm$SS %in% bam.sm$SS[duplicated(bam.sm$SS)],], row.names=F)
```

**NOTES**

* No SS duplicated

##### 5. bcbbs_ident.csv

Intersection of BBS data with Forsite's "mig bird layer". Their modified version of the VRI dataset with modified BecZone, SpeciesGroup, Age, Height, and Rank fields. 

``` {r}
bbs <- read.csv("data/bcbbs_ident.csv", header=T)
colnames(bbs)[1:18]
bbs.sm <- bbs[c("FID_XYBC_BBS_v3", "PCODE", "SS", "FID_migratory_bird")]
```

Which SS are duplicated within datasets? 

``` {r}
kable(bbs.sm[bbs.sm$SS %in% bbs.sm$SS[duplicated(bbs.sm$SS)],], row.names=F)
```

**NOTES**

* No SS duplicated

##### 6. bcwsi_ident.csv

Intersection of new points (from the WSI database) with Forsite's "mig bird layer". Their modified version of the VRI dataset with modified BecZone, SpeciesGroup, Age, Height, and Rank fields. 

``` {r}
wsi <- read.csv("data/bcwsi_ident.csv", header=T)
colnames(wsi)[1:15]
wsi.sm <- wsi[c("FID_BAMNATV4BConly", "PCODE", "SS", "FID_migratory_bird")]
```

Which SS are duplicated within datasets? 

``` {r}
kable(wsi.sm[wsi.sm$SS %in% wsi.sm$SS[duplicated(wsi.sm$SS)],], row.names=F)
```

**NOTES**

* No SS duplicated


## Identify which columns I'll need to keep from these files to intersect with full VRI dataset

I did some quality-checking and formatting in the full VRI dataset (i.e., complete attribute tables from the Forstie VRI and Canfor TFL shapefiles). To ensure I'm using the same corrected data, I'm going to subset that dataset for the sampled polygons. 

This requires me to identify which polygons are associated with each bird point. 

##### Add standard column names and index columns for which layers intersected which

What are the various column names? 

``` {r}
all.dat.l <- list(atlas.sm, bam.sm, bbs.sm, canfortfl.sm, canfortflwsi.sm, wsi.sm)
kable(as.data.frame(do.call(rbind,lapply(all.dat.l, colnames))))
```

** Datasets intersecting Canfor TFL**

``` {r rename.canfor}
canfortfl$BirdLayer <- "XYBC_Natv4_TFLCanfor"
canfortfl$VRIintersectLayer <- "Canfor_TFL_VRI"
colnames(canfortfl)[grep(unique(canfortfl$BirdLayer), colnames(canfortfl))] <- "FID_BIRD"
colnames(canfortfl)[grep(unique(canfortfl$VRIintersectLayer), colnames(canfortfl))] <- "FID_VRI"

canfortflwsi$BirdLayer <- "XY_WSI_TFLCanfor"
canfortflwsi$VRIintersectLayer <- "Canfor_TFL_VRI"
colnames(canfortflwsi)[grep(unique(canfortflwsi$BirdLayer), colnames(canfortflwsi))] <- "FID_BIRD"
colnames(canfortflwsi)[grep(unique(canfortflwsi$VRIintersectLayer), colnames(canfortflwsi))] <- "FID_VRI"
```

** Datasets intersecting Forsite VRI**

``` {r rename.forsite}
# ATLAS
atlas$BirdLayer <- "BC_BCCA_SelectedMigLayer"
atlas$VRIintersectLayer <- "Forsite_VRI"
colnames(atlas)[grep(unique(atlas$BirdLayer), colnames(atlas))] <- "FID_BIRD"
colnames(atlas)[grep("migratory_bird", colnames(atlas))] <- "FID_VRI"

#BAM
bam$BirdLayer <- "BCdatanat4"
bam$VRIintersectLayer <- "Forsite_VRI"
colnames(bam)[grep(unique(bam$BirdLayer), colnames(bam))] <- "FID_BIRD"
colnames(bam)[grep("migratory_bird", colnames(bam))] <- "FID_VRI"

# BBS
bbs$BirdLayer <- "XYBC_BBS_v3"
bbs$VRIintersectLayer <- "Forsite_VRI"
colnames(bbs)[grep(unique(bbs$BirdLayer), colnames(bbs))] <- "FID_BIRD"
colnames(bbs)[grep("migratory_bird", colnames(bbs))] <- "FID_VRI"

# WSI
wsi$BirdLayer <- "BAMNATV4BConly"
wsi$VRIintersectLayer <- "Forsite_VRI"
colnames(wsi)[grep(unique(wsi$BirdLayer), colnames(wsi))] <- "FID_BIRD"
colnames(wsi)[grep("migratory_bird", colnames(wsi))] <- "FID_VRI"
```



#### First remove columns with all NAs so the dataset is more manageable size

``` {r}
cols_to_remove <- do.call(c, lapply(canfortfl, function(x) { #if column is only full of NAs, it returns a 0
  sum(!is.na(unique(x)))
}))

cols_to_remove <- cols_to_remove[cols_to_remove == 0] # isolate columns that were full of NAs (returning 0)

canfortfl_redcol <- canfortfl[-which(colnames(canfortfl) %in% names(cols_to_remove))]
```

#### Which are unique identifiers within the VRI datasets? 

How many rows are there in the dataset? `nrow(canfortfl_redcol)` `r nrow(canfortfl_redcol)`

How many unique IDs from the VRI file? `length(unique(canfortfl_redcol$FID_VRI))` `r length(unique(canfortfl_redcol$FID_VRI))`

How many unique OBJECTIDs? `length(unique(canfortfl_redcol$OBJECTID))` `r length(unique(canfortfl_redcol$OBJECTID))`

``` {r}
demo <- canfortfl_redcol[canfortfl_redcol$FID_VRI %in% canfortfl_redcol[duplicated(canfortfl_redcol$FID_VRI),]$FID_VRI[1:15],]
demo <- demo[order(demo$FID_VRI),]
kable(demo[c("FID_VRI", "OBJECTID", "FID_BIRD", "SS")], row.names=F)
```

**NOTES**

* OBJECTID: appears to be a row indicator. 
* FID_VRI: appears to be a polygon indicator, indicating the unique polygon within the Canfor VRI file

Next step is to double-check that the FID_VRI values are consistent when exported from the full VRI file vs. this intersected one. To make sure I can join on them.


#### Load Full dataset from Canfor TFL VRI 
``` {r}
load("cache/vri_canfortfl_postclean.RData")
vri_canfortfl <- vri_canfortfl_postclean; rm(vri_canfortfl_postclean)

vri_canfor_redcol <- vri_canfortfl[-which(colnames(vri_canfortfl) %in% names(cols_to_remove))]
``` 

Compare where FID_VRI in intersected file is the same as OBJECTID in the full VRI file
``` {r}
FIDs_examine <- unique(canfortfl_redcol$FID_VRI)[unique(canfortfl_redcol$FID_VRI) %in% unique(vri_canfor_redcol$OBJECTID)] # where intersect_canfor:FID_VRI == fullcanfortfl:OBJECTID

intersect_FIDS <- canfortfl_redcol[canfortfl_redcol$FID_VRI %in% FIDs_examine,]
intersect_FIDS <- intersect_FIDS[c("FID_VRI", "MAP_ID", "PROJECTED_DATE", "SPECIES_CD_1", "HARVEST_DATE")]
intersect_FIDS <- intersect_FIDS[!duplicated(intersect_FIDS),]
intersect_FIDS <- intersect_FIDS[order(intersect_FIDS$FID_VRI),]

vri_canfor_FIDS <- vri_canfor_redcol[vri_canfor_redcol$OBJECTID %in% FIDs_examine,c("OBJECTID", "MAP_ID", "PROJECTED_DATE", "SPECIES_CD_1", "HARVEST_DATE")]
vri_canfor_FIDS <- vri_canfor_FIDS[order(vri_canfor_FIDS$OBJECTID),]

kable(rbind(head(vri_canfor_FIDS), tail(vri_canfor_FIDS)), row.names=F)
kable(rbind(head(intersect_FIDS), tail(intersect_FIDS)), row.names=F)
```

** CONCLUSION**

* Looks like **YES**, OBJECTID from full VRI file is the same unique identifier as FID_VRI
* This is perhaps obvious to some people, but I didn't do the GIS queries, so I needed to double-check for my own peace of mind. 

** Next Steps**

* Double-check the same is true for the Forsite VRI file and not just the Canfor one

``` {r clean1}
rm(list=ls())
gc()
```

#### Load Full dataset from Forsite VRI 

``` {r}
load("cache/vri_forsite_postclean.RData")
vri_forsite <- vri_forsite_postclean; rm(vri_forsite_postclean)
```

##### Subset full VRI dataset for those FEATURE_ID in the bird-intersected VRI files. 

``` {r}
atlas <- read.csv("data/bc_atlas_ident.csv", header=T)
atlas <- atlas[order(atlas$FEATURE_ID),]

vri_forsite_intersectIDs <- vri_forsite[vri_forsite$FEATURE_ID %in% atlas$FEATURE_ID,] #subset for those polygons intersected by atlas points.
vri_forsite_intersectIDs <- vri_forsite_intersectIDs[order(vri_forsite_intersectIDs$FEATURE_ID),] #reorder
```

##### Check for consistency between two datasets

``` {r}
cols_to_check <- c("FEATURE_ID", "SpeciesGroup", "PROJ_AGE_1", "PROJ_HEIGHT_1")

vri_forsite_intersectIDs <- vri_forsite_intersectIDs[cols_to_check]
atlas <- atlas[cols_to_check]

kable(head(vri_forsite_intersectIDs), row.names=F )
kable(head(atlas), row.names=F )
```

**NOTES**

* So FEATURE_ID seems to be good for combining the various Forsite_VRI intersected files with the full forsite_FRI file. This is reasonable since we already determined that FEATURE_ID is a unique polygon identifier. 

** Next Steps **

* Before extracting out the intersected IDs to make the final intersected file, I want to do some more quality-checking to identify possible duplicates among the various bird-VRI intersection datasets


## Look for duplicates among datasets (i.e. after combining together)

What are the possible duplication scenarios? 

1.  SS duplicated and intersected FID is the same: suggests the SS was represented in multiple of the avian datasets and intersected with the same VRI dataset twice
2. SS duplicated but intersected FID is different: same SS was intersected with multiple polygons (e.g., from different VRI shapefiles)
3.  FID duplicated for different SS: multiple survey stations intersected the same polygon
4. Need to also check for possibility that FIDs are different for the same polygons b/c they're represented in different shapefile layers. Perhaps I need to use a different column as the polygon ID.

##### Combine Canfor TFL & Forsite datasets

``` {r combine.all.datasets}
alldat <- rbind(canfordat, forsitedat)

Which PCODEs are represented in the duplicated SS?

``` {r}
sort(as.character(unique(alldat$PCODE[which(alldat$SS %in% dupSS)])))
```

**BCCA**
``` {r}
kable(alldat[alldat$SS %in% dupSS & alldat$PCODE %in% "BCCA",], row.names=F)
```

* BCCA: 3 SS duplicated. Same three I expected before. 

**BL2TFL48**
``` {r}

            tail(alldat[alldat$SS %in% dupSS & alldat$PCODE %in% "BL2TFL48",], 10)), row.names=F)
```

![ ^^^ Image. Example for PCODE BL2TFL48](../output/BL2TFL48.jpg)

* BL2TFL48: For several of these SS, stations intersect polygons in Forsite's shapefile that are missing key information, such as SpeciesGroup, resulting in NULL RANK.
    * ACTION: Choose CanforTFL intersection for these. Identify them by looking for a null value in either SPECIES_CD_1, BEC_ZONE_CODE, PROJ_AGE_1, or PROJ_HEIGHT_1.

**CF**
``` {r}
kable(rbind(head(alldat[alldat$SS %in% dupSS & alldat$PCODE %in% "CF",], 10),
            tail(alldat[alldat$SS %in% dupSS & alldat$PCODE %in% "CF",], 10)), row.names=F)
```

![ ^^^ Image. Example for SS CF.Murray.38 ](../output/CF.Murray.38.jpg)

* CF: For several of the PCODE CF SS, stations are are intersecting polygons in Forsite's shapefile that are missing key information, such as SpeciesGroup, resulting in NULL RANK.
    * ACTION: Choose CanforTFL intersection for these. Identify them by looking for a null value in either SPECIES_CD_1, BEC_ZONE_CODE, PROJ_AGE_1, or PROJ_HEIGHT_1.


**CW**
``` {r}
kable(rbind(head(alldat[alldat$SS %in% dupSS & alldat$PCODE %in% "CW",], 10),

```

* CW: Same as for CF and BL2TFL48: stations intersect polygons in Forsite's shapefile that are missing key information, such as SpeciesGroup, resulting in NULL RANK.
    * ACTION: Choose CanforTFL intersection for these. Identify them by looking for a null value in either SPECIES_CD_1, BEC_ZONE_CODE, PROJ_AGE_1, or PROJ_HEIGHT_1.


**TFL48VM**
``` {r}

            tail(alldat[alldat$SS %in% dupSS & alldat$PCODE %in% "TFL48VM",], 10)), row.names=F)
```

* TFL48VM: Same as for CW, CF, and BL2TFL48: stations intersect polygons in Forsite's shapefile that are missing key information, such as SpeciesGroup, resulting in NULL RANK.
    * ACTION: Choose CanforTFL intersection for these. Identify them by looking for a null value in either SPECIES_CD_1, BEC_ZONE_CODE, PROJ_AGE_1, or PROJ_HEIGHT_1.


### Combine the various datasets 

* Remove Canfor TFL Duplicates
* Subset to the rows where we have attributes for all needed columns


#### Remove duplicates

Isolate the replicates/rows I want from the canfordat. Those with PCODES within Canfor TFL and intersecting with Canfor TFL VRI layer. 

``` {r}
canfortflpcodes <- c("TFL48VM", "BL2TFL48", "CW", "CF") #project codes that were duplicate intersected

canforwanted <- canfordat[canfordat$VRIintersectLayer == "Canfor_TFL_VRI" & canfordat$PCODE %in% canfortflpcodes,] # this is all rows within canfor tfl intersection
```

Remove the replicates/rows I DON'T want from the forsitedat. Those with PCODES within Canfor TFL and intersecting the Forsite VRI layer.

``` {r}
forsitedat$TempCode <- paste(forsitedat$PCODE, forsitedat$VRIintersectLayer, sep=".")
head(forsitedat$TempCode)

unwantedcodes <- paste(canfortflpcodes, "Forsite_VRI", sep=".")
head(unwantedcodes)

forsitewanted <- forsitedat[! forsitedat$TempCode %in% unwantedcodes,]
forsitewanted <- forsitewanted[-ncol(forsitewanted)] #remove TempCode columns
```

## Now extract out VRI attributes from the master full VRI file

#### Load pre-processed full VRI file

``` {r}
load("cache/vri_both.RData")
```

##### Intersect to extract

Based on what I discovered above...

* bird points intersecting the Canfor TFL should be linked via FID_VRI in the intersect file and OBJECTID in the vri_both file
* bird points intersecting the Forsite VRI should be linked via FEATURE_ID in both the intersect and the vri_both file

##### Canfor

Need to create a merging ID from FID_VRI and OBJECTID

``` {r}
intersect_canfor <- canforwanted
intersect_canfor$CanforMergingID <- intersect_canfor$FID_VRI
vri_both$CanforMergingID <- vri_both$OBJECTID

intersect_canfor <- merge(intersect_canfor[c("FID_BIRD", "PCODE", "SS", "FID_VRI", "BirdLayer", "VRIintersectLayer", "CanforMergingID")], vri_both[vri_both$VRI_Layer == "Canfor_TFL",], by="CanforMergingID", all.x=T)
nrow(intersect_canfor)
colnames(intersect_canfor)

```

##### Forsite

Use FEATURE_ID as merging ID. 

``` {r}
intersect_forsite <- forsitewanted

intersect_forsite <- merge(intersect_forsite[c("FID_BIRD", "PCODE", "SS", "FID_VRI", "BirdLayer", "VRIintersectLayer", "FEATURE_ID")], vri_both[vri_both$VRI_Layer == "Forsite_VRI",], by="FEATURE_ID", all.x = T)

nrow(intersect_forsite)
colnames(intersect_forsite)
```


##### Combine forsite data and canfortfl data

Need to remove out some columns I don't need.(namely, ID columns) 

``` {r}
cols_to_remove <- c("CanforMergingID", "FEATURE_ID")
intersect_both <- rbind(intersect_canfor[-which(colnames(intersect_canfor) %in% cols_to_remove)], intersect_forsite[-which(colnames(intersect_forsite) %in% cols_to_remove)])
nrow(intersect_both)
colnames(intersect_both)
```

##### Cache all three versions
``` {r}
intersect_canfor <- intersect_both[intersect_both$VRIintersectLayer == "Canfor_TFL_VRI",]
intersect_forsite <- intersect_both[intersect_both$VRIintersectLayer == "Forsite_VRI",]

cache("intersect_canfor")
cache("intersect_forsite")
cache("intersect_both")
```
