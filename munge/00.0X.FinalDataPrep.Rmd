All point count data were included here, including all survey duration intervals and distance intervals. Also all behaviours. We want to exclude some of these.

**Notes**

* There shouldn't be any non-occurrences in the database. i.e., if a species wasn't observed during a given survey, it isn't recorded in the database. We can check this by running `nrow(pcdat[pcdat$ABUND %in% 0,])`: `r nrow(pcdat[pcdat$ABUND %in% 0,])`.
* For reasons I don't understand, some PKEYs have 0 ABUND. I'm not going to investigate this further, and just assume that there's a good reason. 
* Either way, the 0s aren't there for all surveys, so I have to add them
